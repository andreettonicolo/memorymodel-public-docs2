title: "L2 - FinCare AI — Customer Support & Sales Intelligence Example"
description: "FinCare AI is a reference open-source example showing how MemoryModel can be used to power multiple autonomous agents over a shared memory layer. The project demonstrates how long-term, structured memory can transform customer support conversations into actionable sales insights — without interfering with the user experience."

## What this example shows

This example focuses on **memory orchestration**, not just retrieval.

Specifically, it demonstrates how to:

- Share the same memory cluster across multiple agents
- Combine MemoryModel based customer support with autonomous insight extraction
- Persist structured commercial signals during conversations
- Separate _who talks_ from _who observes_

---

## Architecture overview

The system is composed of three main components, all connected to the same MemoryModel cluster:

### 1. Customer Support Agent

- Answers user questions using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Retrieves information from product documentation and user profiles
- Stores long-term user preferences and contextual data

### 2. Spy Node (SalesInsight)

- Runs silently in parallel with the conversation
- Never answers the user
- Observes messages and extracts structured sales signals, such as:
  - implied needs
  - sentiment
  - potential upsell opportunities
- Writes structured data directly into memory

### 3. Operator Dashboard

- Reads only the structured memories generated by the Spy Node
- Displays real-time sales insights to a human operator
- Scores leads based on estimated conversion probability

## Memory nodes used

The example uses multiple memory nodes, defined explicitly by the developer:

- **AppKnowledge**\
  Stores official documentation and product manuals ingested via batch upload.
- **UserProfile**\
  Stores persistent user-level information such as preferences, constraints, and past interactions.
- **SalesInsight**\
  A structured node designed to capture commercial signals inferred from conversations.

All nodes are defined in `nodes.txt` and created explicitly when configuring the memory cluster.

This highlights a core concept of MemoryModel:\
**you decide what is memory-worthy, not the system.**

## Running the example

The full source code is available as an open-source project:

👉 **FinCare AI — GitHub repository**\
https://github.com/MemoryModelRepo/CustomareCare-Upselling-finance-app-public.git

To run the example locally:

1. Create a MemoryModel cluster
2. Define the nodes using `nodes.txt`
3. Ingest documentation into the memory layer
4. Run the customer and operator applications in parallel

Detailed setup instructions are available in the project README.
