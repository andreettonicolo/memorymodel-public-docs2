## What is MemoryModel?

Memory Model is the first autonomous memory architecture.

It is a dynamic system that actively organizes memories, selects retrieval strategies based on intent, and self-optimizes over time.

### Data Structure

Memory Model structures data exactly how the human brain does:

- Episodic Memory: stores individual raw events and data points.
- Semantic Memory: automatically extracts concepts, patterns, and logical relationships into a virtual knowledge graph.
- Procedural Memory: learns behaviors and successful retrieval strategies.

### Query Logic

Memory Model does not treat every query the same, it analyzes the user's intent:

- Factual: uses exact matching for dates and specific entities.
- Conceptual Search: uses semantic embedding similarity for abstract ideas.
- Hybrid Strategy: uses multiple signals for complex, context-heavy queries.

### Search Precision

To solve the inaccuracy of standard vector search, Memory Model calculates mathematical centroids combining:

- The User’s Semantic Interest Profile.
- Query-Specific Relevance.
- Temporal/Contextual Signals.

### Maintenance

Memory Model is never static, but runs a continuous cycle of observations, analysis and execution to:

- Actively consolidates short-term memory into long-term semantic knowledge.
- Operates in the background to refine its understanding of the data.
