title: "Memory Graph"
description: "The Memory Graph is a new interactive topological view designed to reveal the semantic interactions and connections between the different structured fields of your memory. It is an essential tool for understanding the "shape" and relationships within your Knowledge Base at a glance."

### 1. Accessing the Graph

Navigate to the **"Graph"** tab in the top menu bar to open the visualization interface.

### 2. Interactive Topology

The central pane displays your Knowledge Base as a dynamic network:

- **Nodes:** Represent specific memory clusters (e.g., _UserProfile_, _SalesInsight_, _AppKnowledge_).
- **Links:** Visual lines representing the semantic connections and relationships between these data points.
- **Stats:** A summary at the top left (e.g., _70 Memories • 113 Links_) gives you an immediate metric of your graph's density.

### 3. Filtering and Navigation

Customize your view to focus on specific data segments:

- **Graph Filters:** Located in the left sidebar, this allows you to filter the graph by **"Target Users"** (e.g., selecting specific users to view their combined knowledge graph).
- **View Controls:** Use the toolset in the bottom right corner to **Fit** the graph to the screen, or **Zoom In/Out** to explore specific clusters in detail.
