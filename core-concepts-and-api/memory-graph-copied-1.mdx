### 2. Interactive Topology

The central pane displays your Knowledge Base as a dynamic network:

- **Nodes:** Represent specific memory clusters (e.g., _UserProfile_, _SalesInsight_, _AppKnowledge_).
- **Links:** Visual lines representing the semantic connections and relationships between these data points.
- **Stats:** A summary at the top left (e.g., _70 Memories • 113 Links_) gives you an immediate metric of your graph's density.

### 3. Filtering and Navigation

Customize your view to focus on specific data segments:

- **Graph Filters:** Located in the left sidebar, this allows you to filter the graph by **"Target Users"** (e.g., selecting specific users to view their combined knowledge graph).
- **View Controls:** Use the toolset in the bottom right corner to **Fit** the graph to the screen, or **Zoom In/Out** to explore specific clusters in detail.
